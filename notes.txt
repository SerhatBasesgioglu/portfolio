Create a favicon
Look into opengraph-image
twitter property at metadata, it is about opengraph-image again, look into that
use inter at rootlayout, uses local font so ip does not leak to google
use next js image tag instead of html image
overriding the metadata in sub pages, look into generateMetaData() function
look into sitemap, it is important for subpages that is not linked in the website
look into robots.txt stuff
